Sidebar navigation with common YouTube-style sections.​

Responsive video grid displaying multiple video cards with thumbnails, channel avatar, title, author, views, and timestamp overlay.​

Hover tooltips for interactive icons in the header.​

# Tech Stack

CSS:

header.css for the top navigation bar and interactive icons.​

sidebar.css for the left-side menu layout.​

video.css for the responsive video grid and card design.​

general.css for global styles and reset rules.​
